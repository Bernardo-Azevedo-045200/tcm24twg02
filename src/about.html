            <p class="aboutustext"><mark>The Journey Begins</mark><br>Founded in 2010, Tour Travel was born from a dream of connecting people to the world. Its founders, Ana and Carlos, two friends passionate about exploring new places, believed that travel was more than just visiting destinations—it was about creating memories, discovering cultures, and transforming lives.<br>
                With a map on the wall and a burning desire to share their passion, they decided to create a travel agency unlike any other. Their goal was to offer something more personal, more human. And so, Tour Travel began its journey with a clear mission: to make every trip a unique and unforgettable experience.<br>
